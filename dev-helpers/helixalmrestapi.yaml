        Test run steps are read only. You cannot edit the step text. The API expects to receive the same step structure when you update a test run, but you can update the following depending on the View Mode.<br/><br/>


        | View Mode          | Available actions |

        | ------------------ | ----------------- |

        | Grid View          | Update the completed property value (indicates step is complete)<br/>Add, edit, and delete problem statements

        | Text View          | None. Steps are completely read only.

        | Detailed Grid View | Add, edit, and delete problem statements (to step or to specific expected result within step)<br/>Add, edit, and delete actual results<br/>Add, edit, and delete step notes (stepNote values) added after the test run was generated. Cannot add, edit, or delete testCaseStepNote values.<br/>Add or update step results (pass, fail, undetermined)

        /{projectID}/token](#/security/getAccessToken)), Basic Authentication
        (username and password) or API Key Authentication (ID and Secret) must
        be used.


        The following example shows an Authorization header using Basic authentication with the username Administrator and password Password123.


        > GET /helix-alm/api/v0/4/token HTTP/1.1

        > Host: localhost:8443

        > Authorization: Basic YWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcjpQYXNzd29yZDEyMw==


        All subsequent requests require using the access token in the header.

      description: >
        All requests your application sends to the Helix ALM REST API must
        include a header that contains an access token, except for getting a
        list of projects or an access token. Access tokens are generated for a
        project based on a specified Helix ALM username and password and then
        used for subsequent requests. To generate a token, use the [GET
        /{projectID}/token](#/security/getAccessToken) resource.


        The token must be included in the request header preceded by Bearer. For example:


        > GET /helix-alm/api/v0/4/issues HTTP/1.1

        > Host: localhost:8443

        > Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAi3Q6jLTQibGljIjoicH


        By default, tokens expire in seven days. You can set the number of hours before tokens expire in the Helix ALM Registry Utility. See the registry utility help for information. Tokens automatically expire when the Helix ALM Server is restarted. The expiresOn parameter in the response contains the date/time the token expires.

        The following example shows an Authorization header using ApiKey authentication with the API key ID 293bb9a742ec1ceb549368bf64cd2d4c5934a4e0a966ea10d3bedce0a8dd36c7 and the API key secret dd487b2fc38e4a92311d0edac47083eaf2f0379cc0e9210b4a6e3cebd5ce2f4f.
